README for the HIRi Tardis filter
=================================


INTRODUCTION
------------

The HIRi Tardis filter is aimed to be integrated in the `myTardis platform`_, a data 
management system for private lab/facility data.
.. _`myTardis platform`: http://mytardis.github.io/

HIRi Tardis project aims to provide a storage platform for the `Health Innovations 
Research Institute (HIRi)`_ laboratory, located in RMIT University, Bundoora campus.  
.. _`http://www.rmit.edu.au/research/institutes/healthinnovations`

Technically, it enables extracting metadata from files in the PDA files format, created by 
Softmax Pro, program running the Flexstation III micro-wells plates reader, on 
which HIRi scientists run experiments.



METADATA EXTRACTION
-------------------

The PDA format being generated by the proprietary program `Softmax Pro`_, the PDA files 
had to be reverse-engineered to extract the informations. The PDA format can be 
interpreted using an hexadecimal editor. It is composed of several sections, containing
data and/or metadata.

*Some details about the structure of the PDA format will be added here later*

KNOWN ISSUES
------------

- Even though most of the PDA files can be read, some of them have extra or unexpected 
section(s) that make the extraction fail. In that case, no metadata are extracted.

- The following metadata are required, but so far could not be extracted:
	- Read time: Date and time when the plate read was done
	- Section kind: Plate or Cuvette
	- Read Type: Endpoint, Kinetic, Spectrum, Well Scan or Flex
	- Data mode: for absorbance plates: Absorbance or % Transmittance. For others: 
	Fluorescence, Luminescence, or Time Resolved Fluorescence
	- Data Type: Raw or Reduced
	- Reads per Well: number of times a well is read for a single reading
	- PMT Settings: Automatic, High, Medium, or Low
	
- No unit testing has been designed or performed yet on this filter
